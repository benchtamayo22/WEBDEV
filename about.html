        <p id="bio1">Hi, I'm Bench Tamayo, an 18-year-old BSIT student at Lorma College. I'm passionate about technology
            and love coding, with dreams of becoming a Web Developer in the future.
            My hobbies include playing online games, driving, traveling, and playing badminton. I
            take badminton seriously and train a lot, making me a competitive player.
            I enjoy driving and traveling alone because it gives me a sense of freedom. At school, I'm known for being
            noisy and playful, but at home, I prefer staying in my room, enjoying my own space.
        </p>
