        My Chemical Romance
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Well, when you go<br>
        Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay<br>
        And maybe when you get back
        I'll be off to find another way
    </p>
        
    <p>
        And after all this time that you still owe<br>
        You're still a good-for-nothing, I don't know<br>
        So take your gloves and get out
        Better get out while you can
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When you go, and would you even turn to say<br>
        "I don't love you like I did yesterday"?<br>
    </p>        

    <p>
        Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading<br>
        So sick and tired of all the needless beating<br>
        But baby, when they knock you down and out
        Is where you oughta stay
    </p>

    <p>
        And after all the blood that you still owe<br>
        Another dollar's just another blow
        So fix your eyes and get up<br>
        Better get up while you can<br>
        Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
    </p>

    <p>
        When you go, and would you even turn to say<br>
        "I don't love you like I did yesterday"?
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, come on, come on
    </p>

    <p>
        When you go, would you have the guts to say<br>
        "I don't love you like I loved you yesterday"?
    </p>

    <p>
        I don't love you like I loved you yesterday<br>
        I don't love you like I loved you yesterday
    </p>
